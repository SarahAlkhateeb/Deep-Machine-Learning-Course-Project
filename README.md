# Deep-Machine-Learning-Course-Project




**Deep Machine learning project:**

We applied the You Only Look Once (YOLOv4) algorithm on real-world challenges in the security field because YOLO approved to be the fastest so far and can be implemented in real-time detection. Automating security camera detection could be beneficial, especially if it were fast enough to send an alert in real-time.
